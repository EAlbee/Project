### Project Problem Statement and Plan

Hi Eric, This sounds like an interesting application and since you are both the customer and the developer, it should be easy to gather user requirements!

* Project object/problem statement looks good. Consider saving this as a .md (markdown) file so you can pretty up the formatting. Think of GitHub as your professional portfolio that prospective employers might look at (I know you already have that dev job, but still...). Switching from a plain text file to markdown will improve the look quite a bit. You can use any of the course repositories for a sample of how to use markdown (syllabus, for example).

* You have a good start at your schedule, but I'd like to see more detailed tasks here.  To help with that process, you might make a list of all the tasks that will need to be completed and assign a time estimate to them. Then, take those tasks and get them on the calendar. Here's a start at a list to help you: design UI, design database, document application flow, create database tables, add data to tables, write weekly blog/wiki/status report, design classes, research restaurant web services, etc.

* Regarding a way to search for restaurants in a given area, you might check out [ProgrammableWeb](http://www.programmableweb.com/news/35-restaurant-apis-unofficial-open-table-food-genius-and-menu-mania/2013/06/05). There may be some google mapping apis that could help as well, depending on what direction you want to take with the application. 

* What will your individual research topic/technique/technology be?
