I want to create a site that I can enter Restaurant name, food item, datetime of visit, rating and cost of the visit.
I want to be able to retrieve info based on a certain time period(per month), food item(ribs, pizza, fish fry...), or Restaurant that I have been to.

Not sure if I can create a search of places in Madison...?
